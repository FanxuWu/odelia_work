\# Task 2 – Visualization of MRI Modalities using 3D Slicer



\## Case Information

\- Institution: CAM

\- UID: ODELIA\_BRAID1\_0158\_1\_left

\- Modalities visualized: Pre, T2, Post\_1, Post\_2, Sub\_1



\## Observations

1\. \*\*Pre vs. Post\_1\*\*  

&nbsp;  In the pre-contrast image, the lesion region appears relatively homogeneous with moderate signal intensity.  

&nbsp;  After contrast injection (Post\_1), a clear enhancement is visible within the lesion, suggesting increased vascularization and active contrast inflow.



2\. \*\*Post\_1 vs. Post\_2\*\*  

&nbsp;  Compared to Post\_1, the Post\_2 image shows a mild decrease in lesion signal intensity.  

&nbsp;  This pattern is consistent with contrast wash-out, commonly observed in malignant or highly vascularized lesions.



3\. \*\*Pre vs. T2\*\*  

&nbsp;  On T2-weighted imaging, the lesion appears hyperintense compared to the surrounding tissue.  

&nbsp;  This indicates fluid or edema components within the lesion, providing structural context before enhancement.



4\. \*\*Sub\_1 (Post\_1 – Pre)\*\*  

&nbsp;  The subtraction image clearly highlights the enhanced region, isolating the contrast inflow area from the background tissue.  

&nbsp;  It provides the best visualization of lesion borders and contrast uptake kinetics.



\## Conclusion

The dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI sequence successfully demonstrates the inflow and wash-out characteristics of the lesion.  

The combination of \*\*Pre, Post\_1, Post\_2, and Sub\_1\*\* allows accurate assessment of enhancement patterns.  

\*\*T2 imaging\*\* complements this by revealing internal lesion components such as edema or necrosis.  

Overall, these visualizations confirm that dynamic MRI can effectively differentiate benign from malignant tissue based on temporal signal changes.
